# Hashing-Toolbox
This is a convenient hashing toolbox designed for comparing existing unsupervised and supervised hashing methods.  
*It is based on original version contributed from github: @willard-yuan*  
The compared methods includes:
## Data-independent Hashing
* **Similarity Search in High Dimensions via Hashing (LSH)**  [Paper](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring13/cos598C/Gionis.pdf)

## Data-dependent Hashing
### Unsupervised Methods
* **Iterative Quantization: A Procerustean Approach to Learning Binary Codes (ITQ)**  [Paper](http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/publications/cvpr11_small_code.pdf)

### Supervised Methods
